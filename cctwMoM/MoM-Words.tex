We similarly define $\hEndMin_{t}$ as `minimal human wealth,' the
present discounted value of labor income if the shocks were to take on
their worst possible value in every future period \pShkOn
{$\tShkEmp_{t+n} = \tShkEmpMin ~\forall~n>0$ and $\pShk_{t+n} =
  \pShkMin ~\forall~n>0$} {$\tShkEmp_{t+n} = \tShkEmpMin
  ~\forall~n>0$} (which we define as corresponding to the beliefs of a
`pessimist').

\ctw{}{We will call a `realist' the consumer who correctly perceives the true
probabilities of the future risks and optimizes accordingly.}

A first useful point is that, for the realist, a lower bound for the
level of market resources is $\ushort{m}_{t} = -\hEndMin_{t}$, because
if ${m}_{t}$ equalled this value then there would be a positive finite
chance (however small) of receiving \pShkOn
{$\tShkEmp_{t+n}=\tShkEmpMin$ and $\pShk_{t+n}=\pShkMin$}
{$\tShkEmp_{t+n}=\tShkEmpMin$}
in
every future period, which would require the consumer to set ${c}_{t}$
to zero in order to guarantee that the intertemporal budget constraint
holds\ctw{.}{~(this is the multiperiod generalization of the discussion in
section \ref{subsec:LiqConstrSelfImposed} about
$\ushort{a}_{T-1}$).}  Since consumption of zero yields negative
infinite utility, the solution to realist consumer's problem is not well
defined for values of ${m}_{t} < \ushort{m}_{t}$, and the limiting
value of the realist's ${c}_t$ is zero as ${m}_{t} \downarrow \ushort{m}_{t}$.

Given this result, it will be convenient to define `excess' market
resources as the amount by which actual resources exceed the lower
bound, and `excess' human wealth as the amount by which mean expected human wealth
exceeds guaranteed minimum human wealth:
\begin{eqnarray*}
    \aboveMin \mRat_{t} & = & {m}_{t}+\overbrace{\hEndMin_{t}}^{=-\ushort{m}_{t}}
\\  \aboveMin \hEnd_{t} & = & \hEnd_{t}-\hEndMin_{t}.
\end{eqnarray*}

We can now transparently define the optimal
consumption rules for the two perfect foresight problems, those of the
`optimist' and the `pessimist.'  The `pessimist' perceives human
wealth to be equal to its minimum feasible value $\hEndMin_{t}$ with certainty, so
consumption is given by the perfect foresight solution
\begin{eqnarray*}
  \cFuncBelow_{t}(m_{t}) & = & ({m}_{t}+\hEndMin_{t})\MinMPC_{t}
\\ & = & \aboveMin \mRat_{t}\MinMPC_{t}
.
\end{eqnarray*}

The `optimist,' on the other hand, pretends that there is no uncertainty
about future income, and therefore consumes
\begin{eqnarray*}
    \cFuncAbove_{t}(m_{t}) & = & ({m}_{t} +\hEndMin_{t} - \hEndMin_{t} + \hEnd_{t} )\MinMPC_{t}
\\   & = & (\aboveMin \mRat_{t} + \aboveMin \hEnd_{t})\MinMPC_{t}
\\     & = & \cFuncBelow_{t}(m_{t})+\aboveMin \hEnd_{t} \MinMPC_{t}
.
\end{eqnarray*}

It seems obvious that the spending of the realist will be strictly greater
than that of the pessimist and strictly less than that of the
optimist.  Figure~\ref{fig:IntExpFOCInvPesReaOptNeedHiPlot} illustrates the proposition for the consumption rule in period $T-1$.
