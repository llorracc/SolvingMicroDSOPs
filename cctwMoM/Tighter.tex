\cite{BufferStockTheory} derives an upper limit  $\MaxMPC_{t}$ for the MPC as $m_{t}$
approaches its lower bound.  Using this
fact plus the strict concavity of the consumption function yields the
proposition that
\begin{eqnarray}
\cFunc_{t}(\ushort{m}_{t}+\aboveMin \mRat_{t}) & < \MaxMPC_{t} \aboveMin \mRat_{t}.
\end{eqnarray}

The solution method described above does not guarantee that
approximated consumption will respect this constraint between gridpoints, and a failure to
respect the constraint can occasionally cause computational problems in solving
or simulating the model.  Here, we
describe a method for constructing an approximation that always
satisfies the constraint.

That is, the realist's consumption function is bounded from above by both
the \textit{unconstrained} optimist's problem already treated, as well as
by the \textit{constrained} optimist's problem, which is a 45 degree line
originating from $\ushort{m}_{t}$ on the $m$-axis, as shown in
Figure~\ref{fig:IntExpFOCInvPesReaOptNeed45Plot}. The same is true for
the value function, as illustrated in Figure
\ref{fig:IntExpFOCInvPesReaOptNeed45ValuePlot}.
