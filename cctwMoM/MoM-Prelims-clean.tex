  As a preliminary to our solution, define $\hNrm_{\EndStg}$ as end-of-period human wealth (the present discounted value of future labor income) for a perfect foresight version of the problem of a `risk optimist:' a period-$t$ consumer who believes with perfect confidence that the shocks will always take their expected value of \PermShkOn{1, $\tranShkEmp_{t+n} = \Ex[\tranShkEmp]=1~\forall~n>0$ and $\permShk_{t+n} = \Ex[\permShk]=1~\forall~n>0$.}{1, $\tranShkEmp_{t+n} = \Ex[\tranShkEmp]=1~\forall~n>0$.}  The solution to a perfect foresight problem of this kind takes the form\footnote{For a derivation, see \cite{BufferStockTheory}; $\MPCmin_{t}$ is defined therein as the MPC of the perfect foresight consumer with horizon $T-t$.}
