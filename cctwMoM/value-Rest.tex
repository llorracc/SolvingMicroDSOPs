\MPCMatch{with derivative
\begin{eqnarray*}
  \bar{\vInv}_{t}^{m} & = & (\mathbb{C}_{t}^{T})^{1/(1-\CRRA)}\MinMPC_{t},
\\ & = & \MinMPC_{t}^{-\CRRA/(1-\CRRA)} % 20190820
\end{eqnarray*}}{}
and since $\mathbb{C}_{t}^{T}$ is a constant while the consumption
function is linear, $\bar{\vInv}_{t}$ will also be linear.

We apply the same transformation to the value function for the problem with uncertainty (the ``realist's'' problem)\MPCMatch{ and differentiate}:
\begin{eqnarray*}
  \bar{\vInv}_{t} & = & \left((1-\CRRA)\bar{\vFunc}_{t}({m}_{t})\right)^{1/(1-\CRRA)}
\MPCMatch{\\ \bar{\vInv}^{m}_{t} & = & \left((1-\CRRA)\bar{\vFunc}_{t}({m}_{t})\right)^{-1+1/(1-\CRRA)}\bar{\vFunc}_{t}^{m}({m}_{t})}{}
\end{eqnarray*}
and an excellent approximation to the value function can be obtained by
calculating the values of $\bar{\vInv}$ at the same gridpoints used by the
consumption function approximation, and interpolating among those points.

However, as with the consumption approximation, we can do even better if we
realize that the $\bar{\vInv}$ function for the optimist's problem is
an upper bound for the ${\vInv}$ function in the presence of uncertainty, and the value function
for the pessimist is a lower bound. Analogously to \eqref{eq:koppa}, define an upper-case
\begin{eqnarray}
\hat{\Koppa}_{t}(\mu_{t})  & = & \left(\frac{\bar{\vInv}_{t}(\ushort{m}_{t}+e^{\mu_{t}})-\vInv_{t}(\ushort{m}_{t}+e^{\mu_{t}})}{\aboveMin \hEnd_{t} \MinMPC_{t} (\mathbb{C}_{t}^{T})^{1/(1-\CRRA)}}\right) \label{eq:Koppa}
\end{eqnarray}
\MPCMatch{with derivative (dropping arguments)
\begin{eqnarray}
 \hat{\Koppa}_{t}^{\mu}  & = & (\aboveMin \hEnd_{t} \MinMPC_{t} (\mathbb{C}_{t}^{T})^{1/(1-\CRRA)})^{-1}e^{\mu_{t}}\left(\bar{\vInv}^{m}_{t}-\vInv^{m}_{t}\right) \label{eq:KoppaPrime}
%\\ & = &  (\aboveMin \hEnd_{t} \MinMPC_{t})^{-1}e^{\mu_{t}}\left((\mathbb{C}_{t}^{T})^{1/(1-\CRRA)}\MinMPC_{t}-\left((1-\CRRA)\vFunc_{t}({m}_{t})\right)^{-1+1/(1-\CRRA)}\vFunc_{t}^{m}({m}_{t})\right)  \notag
\end{eqnarray}}{}
and an upper-case version of the $\chiFunc$ equation in \eqref{eq:chi}:
\begin{eqnarray}
  \hat{\Chi}_{t}(\mu_{t}) & = & \log \left(\frac{1-\hat{\Koppa}_{t}(\mu_{t})}{\hat{\Koppa}_{t}(\mu_{t})}\right)
\\ & = & \log \left(1/\hat{\Koppa}_{t}(\mu_{t})-1\right) \label{eq:Chi}
\end{eqnarray}
\MPCMatch{with corresponding derivative
\begin{eqnarray}
 \hat{\Chi}_{t}^{\mu} & = & \left(\frac{-\hat{\Koppa}_{t}^{\mu}/\hat{\Koppa}_{t}^{2}}{1/\hat{\Koppa}_{t}-1}\right)
\end{eqnarray}}{}
and if we approximate these objects then invert them (as above with
the $\Hi{\koppa}$ and $\Hi{\chiFunc}$ functions) we obtain a very high-quality
approximation to our inverted value function at the same points for
which we have our approximated value function:
\begin{eqnarray}
  \hat{\vInv}_{t} & = & \bar{\vInv}_{t}-\overbrace{\left(\frac{1}{1+\exp(\hat{\Chi}_{t})}\right)}^{=\hat{\Koppa}_{t}} \aboveMin \hEnd_{t} \MinMPC_{t} (\mathbb{C}_{t}^{T})^{1/(1-\CRRA) }
\end{eqnarray}
from which we obtain our approximation to the value function\MPCMatch{ and its derivatives~}~as \hypertarget{vHatFunc}{}
\begin{eqnarray*}
    \hat{\vFunc}_{t} & = & \util(\hat{\vInv}_{t})
\\  \hat{\vFunc}^{m}_{t} & = & \util^{\prime}(\hat{\vInv}_{t}) \hat{\vInv}^{m}
\MPCMatch{\\  \hat{\vFunc}^{mm}_{t} & = & \util^{\prime\prime}(\hat{\vInv}_{t}) (\hat{\vInv}^{m})^{2} + \util^{\prime}(\hat{\vInv}_{t})\hat{\vInv}^{mm}}{}
.
\end{eqnarray*}

Although a linear interpolation that matches the level of $\vInv$ at
the gridpoints is simple, a Hermite interpolation that matches both
the level and the derivative of the $\bar{\vInv}_{t}$ function at the
gridpoints has the considerable virtue that the $\bar{\vFunc}_{t}$ derived from it numerically satisfies
the envelope theorem at each of the gridpoints for which the problem
has been solved.

\MPCMatch{If we use the double-derivative calculated above to produce a higher-order Hermite polynomial, our approximation will also match
  marginal propensity to consume at the gridpoints; this would
  guarantee that the consumption function generated from the value
  function would match both the level of consumption and the
  marginal propensity to consume at the gridpoints; the numerical
  differences between the newly constructed consumption function and
  the highly accurate one constructed earlier would be negligible
  within the grid.}{}
