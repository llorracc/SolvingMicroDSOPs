# Tables

Generated by reproduction and estimation:

- **estimate_results.csv** — main structural estimation results (written by `Code/Python/StructEstimation.py`).
- **bootstrap_results.csv** — bootstrap standard errors (when run via `do_all.py` with the appropriate option).
- **EstResults.tex** — LaTeX table of estimation results.

After running `./reproduce.sh`, **estimate_results.csv** should match the committed version within numerical tolerance. Small floating-point differences across platforms are acceptable.
