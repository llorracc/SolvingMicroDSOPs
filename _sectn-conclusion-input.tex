\section{Conclusion}

Many choices can be made for solving microeconomic dynamic stochastic optimization problems.  The set of techniques, and associated code, described in these notes represents an approach that I have found to be powerful, flexible, and efficient, but other problems may require other techniques.  For a much broader treatment of many of the issues considered here, see Judd~\citeyearpar{judd:book}.
