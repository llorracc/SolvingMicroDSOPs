# Required LaTeX Packages for SolvingMicroDSOPs
# Single Source of Truth for tlmgr package installation
#
# This file is read by reproduce/docker/setup.sh and the Dockerfile,
# and drives `tlmgr install`.
# Lines beginning with # are comments. Inline comments are also stripped.
#
# Packages already included in collection-basic are noted with ❌ and
# commented out. Packages whose .sty name differs from the tlmgr name
# are annotated with the .sty they provide.
#
# The econark document class (econark.cls) pulls in a large collection of
# packages automatically; any package it requires is implicitly needed here too.
