and whose circumstances evolve according to the transition equations\footnote{The usual analysis of dynamic programming problems combines the equations below into a single expression; here, they are disarticulated to highlight the important point that several distinct processes (intertemporal choice, stochastic shocks, intertemporal returns, income growth) are involved in the transition from one period to the next.}\ifthenelse{\boolean{MyNotes}}{\marginpar{\tiny Note that ${\aLvl}$ is savings, not saving.
