# Python packages for BinderHub / MyBinder
#
# BinderHub installs these via pip into its managed Python environment.
# This file is intentionally simpler than pyproject.toml because BinderHub
# imposes build-time limits and does not support UV or lock files.
#
# For the full reproducible environment (Docker / devcontainer) see:
#   pyproject.toml  +  uv.lock  +  reproduce/docker/setup.sh
